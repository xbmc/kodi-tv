    title: Kodi v20 & v21 Nightly Development Builds
    description: >-
      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent
      changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should
      only be used by testers and advanced users to help us find possible bugs.


      These builds may occassionally be unstable, so be sure to always backup before using a development/nightly build.


      If you want a stable setup, then please install a stable build from the **Recommended** tab instead.
