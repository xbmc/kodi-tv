    title: Kodi v21.1 (Omega)
    description: Kodi for MacOS runs natively on Mac OSX. Mac OSX can provide
      hardware video decoding for H.264 and MPEG2 video, though most CPUs are
      able to use software decoding for other formats in 1080 as well. Macs can
      use the Apple TV remote, among others, for control of Kodi. An Intel or
      Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 10.14 or higher is required.

    title: Kodi v21 & v22 Nightly Development Builds
    description: >-
      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent
      changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should
      only be used by testers and advanced users to help us find possible bugs.


      These builds may occassionally be unstable, so be sure to always backup before using a development/nightly build.


      If you want a stable setup, then please install a stable build from the **Recommended** tab instead.
