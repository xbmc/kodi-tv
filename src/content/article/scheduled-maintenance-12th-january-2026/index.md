**UPDATE 13 Jan 19:00 UTC:** The servers didn't come back up for some reason - we've tried a few things, but that didn't work so we're now working with the hosting provider to resolve this. We don't yet have any timeline for resolution.

We don't do this very often, but, sometimes, life happens, and it's only fair to forewarn you.

We've been notified by one of our hosting providers of scheduled maintenance that will take our mirror servers off air for a while. During this window, you will not have access to downloads of anything we host - so, basically any new downloads of the Kodi application and add-ons. Kodi itself will remain available where it's hosted in a third-party repository (e.g. an app store).

The window for this maintenance is:

**Monday,  January 12 2026**, between **10AM and 6PM PST** - so **18:00 12 January to 06:00 13 January UTC**.

We'll obviously bring everything back on line as soon as we can, but assume **no** access within these hours. If you have to try installing anything, be aware that it will error and none of the admins will be able to check what's happening either. Please, just ignore any errors on launch for now, and wait until the mirrors all come back and synchronise.
