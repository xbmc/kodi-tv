We are happy and sad at same time to announce that this will be the last v17.x release. When we say very last this, of course, only means for the v17 "Krypton" series as we are steadily heading towards the new v18 series called "Leia". For about a year already our developers have been working on the upcoming v18 release and have been backporting all fixes we deemed safe enough to v17 series. However with all good things there has to come a time to say enough is enough, and that moment has come. From our point of view "Krypton" has been a great release and our group has spend a lot of time improving it since its initial release on 5 February 2017. It has also been one of the series where we did things a bit different with continuous nightly versions for testing and quite a lot of point releases with only minor fixes just because we could.

 We are certainly excited about our upcoming v18 on which we will start reporting at regular basis quite soon - but, until that time, here's the v17.6 "Krypton" version for daily use. We recommend that every one upgrade to this version once it's available for their platform to have the best experience possible. If you want to know what has changed you can browse the list below.

 #### Fixes done in this release:

 
 * Fix possible crash in controller dialog
 * Update standard scrapers to latest version available on release
 * Fix possible connection issues with internal webserver
 * Fix crash when peripheral joystick add-on is disabled
 
 #### What else is new?

 In the bugfix releases we never include any new features. They are as feature-complete as the initial version, with the difference only being stability and usability fixes. If you are curious you can read up on all the v17 changes here: [Kodi v17.0 “Krypton”](https://kodi.tv/kodi17)

 #### Where can I download Kodi?

 As alway you can find the official builds on our [download page](https://kodi.tv/download). Then click on the platform of choice and select the build you need. You can install these builds just on top of your current Kodi installation without doing a reinstall or cleanup as we do a full migration if needed. All you add-ons or installed skin will keep working.

 For Android devices not connected to Play Store you can install the following add-on from our repo (listed under "Programs") which will make the upgrading easier straight from the Kodi interface: [Kodi Android Installer](https://kodi.tv/addon/scripts/kodi-android-installer)

 ##### Apparel, donations or getting involved

 Getting involved is quite easy. We encourage you to report problems with these builds on our forum first and after that, if asked, submit bugs on Trac (following this guide: [How to submit a bug report](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Submit_a_bug_report)). Do note that we need detailed information so we can investigate the issue. We also appreciate providing support in our [Forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/ "Kodi Forums") where you can. You can of course also follow or help promote Kodi on all available social networks. Read more on the [get involved](https://kodi.tv/get-involved) page. We are always happy to receive a [donation](https://kodi.tv/contribute/donate "Donate") by which you show your support and appreciation, and t-shirts and Raspberry Pi cases may still be found on the sidebar for purchase. All donations and other income goes towards the XBMC foundation and are typically used for travel to attend conferences, any necessary paperwork and legal fees, purchasing necessary hardware and licenses for developers and hopefully the yearly XBMC Foundation Developers Conference.
