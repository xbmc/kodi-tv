**Update: Of course, this was an open source joke. We're going to keep supporting all the platforms and keep our Kodi username. The [XBMC shirt is actually real though](https://teespring.com/nextxbmcshirt#pid=374&cid=100046&sid=front), so you are welcome to keep grabbing those if you, but only for a few more days.**

As many of you may have noticed, Google has decided to remove autocomplete support for the word Kodi. While the team finds this move disappointing, we've determined a real solution for the problem. While Kodi no longer autocompletes, XBMC still does! As such, starting today, we are officially changing our name back to XBMC.

But we're not stopping there. We've had a good long run being a multi-platform system, but at the end of the day covering six or more platforms has become far too much of a stress. Android support alone taxes our resources in a way no volunteer development team can ever reasonably be expected to handle. And all the other platforms just makes this worse. So, in an executive decision that we believe the entire community will support, we at Team XBMC have decided to fully embrace our roots.

Starting today, we would like to announce that we are exclusively supporting only the Xbox One. We will be disabling support for all other platforms in the forum starting immediately and will begin shifting our website to reflect this change in the very near future. The [work to make Kodi for Xbox a premier platform](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-xbox-one) has finally paid off!

Making this decision was not easy. For example, there was a lot of debate about whether to fully embrace the name XBMC, or to change to XBOMC (Xbox One Media Center), but at the end of the day, we thought tradition should win out. Also, the current numbering scheme was developed for multiplatform support, so we decided that our upcoming release should be renamed AND RENUMBERED from Kodi 18.0 to XBMC 3.0.0. It just makes sense!

We will be reskinning XBMC 3.0.0 to something a bit more appropriate ASAP. But we’re excited to say that because we are only supporting a single platform, we anticipate full release this April, or at the latest early May!

In addition, we're excited to announce a [limited 3 day sale for this rename featuring XBMC shirts, mugs, and stickers](https://teespring.com/nextxbmcshirt#pid=374&cid=100046&sid=front)!

Thanks for sticking with us all these years! And Android, OSX, iOS, and Linux... see ya later!
