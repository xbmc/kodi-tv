**The Kodi Foundation is very proud to announce that it has joined the Linux Foundation as an Associate Member.** It seemed natural for us to join, given the fact that we are strong believers in the benefits of open-source software.

 We strongly believe that open-source is the best way to achieve awesome things. That was and still is what moves Kodi forward. Ever since XBMP, where this project started, a small group of like-minded individuals from different backgrounds have worked together to achieve a goal, taking advantage of each other's merits and talents.

 That leads to true innovation. Innovation that would not be possible if Kodi's code base was closed source. Innovation that would not be possible if the goals were constrained by corporate vision and allocated resources.

 This is a story that happens every day. An individual shares some code thinking "*meh, no one is interested in this*". Two days later someone across the globe sends a patch to fix a bug or suggest an improvement. Now there are two individuals working on a common problem. They don't know each other but they are working together, sharing ideas. When people cooperate and share, the project at hand and the community will always benefit.

 The **[Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/ "Linux Foundation")** is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux and open source in general, providing support for the open-source community through financial and intellectual resources, governance structure, IT infrastructure, services, events, and **[training and certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/ "training and certification")**.

 Some of its most notable work includes sponsoring the Linux creator Linus Torvalds, maintaining the Linux trademark and **[linux.com website](https://www.linux.com/ "linux.com website")** and organizing the world’s leading **[Linux conferences](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/ "Linux conferences")** where the creators, maintainers and practitioners of the most important open source projects meet.

 With more than **[1000 members](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/members/ "1000 members")** across the world, the Linux Foundation has taken its experience and expertise in supporting the Linux community to help establish, build, and sustain some of the most critical open source technologies. Its work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation in every layer of the software stack, hosting projects spanning enterprise IT, embedded systems, consumer electronics, cloud, networking, and more.
