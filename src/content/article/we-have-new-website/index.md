Now that our little April Fools' joke, which you can [read more about here](/article/andwere-baaaaack), is over, we're excited to announce that both kodi.tv and addons.kodi.tv have been fully updated and renewed! In addition, we're working hard right now to update our forums to the latest version of the forum software, so those should be up to date in the next few weeks.

This update has been years in the making, with work from numerous team members, including, but not limited to: h.udo, jez500, razze, kib, the artwork guys da-anda and samfisher, piers, martijn, and myself, along with brand new help from [Acquia and their excellent Drupal cloud hosting](https://www.acquia.com/) including their great support team there.

[![](https://xbmcfoundation.prod.dd:8083/sites/default/files/sponsor/field_image/acquia_no_tagline.webp)](https://www.acquia.com/) The original plan - and, indeed, numerous designs - were based around the concept of simply updating Wordpress, but it was pointed out that, by switching to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), we could unify our codebase for the website and for the newly update [online add-on browser](/addons) whilst providing much more flexibility moving forward. We hope that the browser will become more and more useful as time goes on, with the intent of tremendously simplifying the work that we do while simultaneously making new content easier than ever to find for our users.

There are a few items we'd especially like to point out with this new site. To begin, it's mobile-friendly and fully responsive... that's right, we've finally joined the world of 2011! And beyond that, our front page is now a real front page, with descriptions, links, and an explanation of who and what Kodi is. The first few posts of the blog can be found there, or you can find the full blog listing at [The Blog](/blog).

The [updated download page](/download) has been made simpler and tidier, giving people some ideas as to what they might do and how they might contribute back to this free, user-created project - all while they're downloading and installing Kodi.

As time goes on, we hope to continue to improve it. To that end, we've opened up a [forum thread dedicated specifically to discussing what you like about the site, what you don't like, and what constructive ideas you might have for the future](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=311023). Please, don't hesitate to post your own ideas for improvement.

#### Conclusion

We hope you like the site as much as we enjoyed putting it together. And, as always, we invite you to [participate in Kodi](/get-involved), whether by helping in the forums, [donating](/contribute/donate), or buying a [cool shirt or official Kodi branded Raspberry Pi case](/store).

In fact, if you happen to live in the US, we understand that it is now possible to buy an official Kodi shirt not just on our Teespring store, but [directly from Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Teespring-Graffiti-Specialized-Tagless-XXX-Large/dp/B06XWZX6FS/). If and when this gets rolled out internationally, we'll keep you updated.
