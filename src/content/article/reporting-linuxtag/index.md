We have been attending LinuxTag in Berlin, Germany since wednesday the 11th.

As always it has been a great experience and we have meet a lot of interested people, both current users and hopefully new users.

As you can see, we have been pretty busy demonstrating the system, most people have been pleased that we run on so many platforms including iOS

## User Meetup

For the fun part, we are having a user meetup this evening @ [Hops & Barleys](http://www.hopsandbarley.eu). The adress is [Wühlischstr 22/23](https://web2.cylex.de/stadtplan/Berlin-1/Berlin-strasse-w%C3%BChlischstr.html)

We will be there from around 21.30, probably earlier. If you can make it, do show up.
