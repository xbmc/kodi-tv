![tmdb-logo](/sites/default/files/uploads/tmdb-logo-128x101.png "tmdb-logo")Our friends at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) have experienced a major hard drive failure (the database is fine) and they are hard at work rebuilding. This obviously means that XBMC will not be able to scrape movie information from TMDB at this time. There is no need to report the issue, please be patient as they recover. You can watch the status on their [twitter page](https://twitter.com/themoviedb). Good luck guys, and thanks for all you do!

 **Update:** Looks like the site is back up and scraping is functional.
