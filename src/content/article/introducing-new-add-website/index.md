XBMC is a comprehensive piece of software in its own right, but what really gives it power, is the ability to extend the features beyond the normal application through 3rd party Add-ons. In the recent times we have encouraged more users to develop these Add-ons, with over 450 currently in the official repository. Many more Add-ons are scattered in unofficial repositories around the web.

You can install an Add-on from inside XBMC by simply browsing the official repository and clicking through the XBMC GUI. What we have been missing for a long time is a way to discover these amazing extensions to XBMC through the web. So without further ado.. we introduce you to:

<http://addons.xbmc.org>

**Some features:**

- Source Code Links
- Forum Links
- Download stats
- License Details
- Icons
- Search box (top right)
- Random Add-Ons
- Recent, new and popular lists
- Developer charts

We have grand plans for the website in the future including screenshots, a developers upload area, user ratings/reviews, development tutorials and direct donation links so people can finally be rewarded for their work. If you have any suggestions please feel free to comment below or in the dedicated [thread on our forums](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=177783). As with all parts of XBMC, the Add-On website is opensource and available on GitHub account to download and contribute to. We would also like to remind current Add-on developers to update their addons.xml with the relevant information to show on the website.

NOTE: This website only shows Add-ons uploaded to our official repository that have passed our [submission process](https://kodi.wiki/view/Official_add-on_repository)
