[![scale_12x_dodecahedron](/sites/default/files/uploads/scale_12x_dodecahedron-300x116.png)](/sites/default/files/uploads/scale_12x_dodecahedron.png)Greetings XBMC users in the southern California region! We’d like to take this time to formally invite you to come visit us at our booth at the [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale12x/ "SCALE 12x") this Saturday and Sunday (Feb. 22nd-23rd) at the [Hilton Los Angeles Airport Hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/HILTON+LOS+ANGELES+AIRPORT/@33.9458927,-118.3815991,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2b6d0ab867dfd:0x677d718bedcbed3f "Hilton airport on Google Maps"). Manning the booth this year are natethomas (Nathan Betzen), Keith (Keith Herrington), nedscott (Ned Scott), and garbear (Garrett Brown). As always we’re hoping to show off some of the latest and greatest XBMC gear, gadgets, and updates. If you’d like to get an inside look into development or if you’d just like to yell at us about a critical missing feature, we’d love to see you.

 In addition, on Friday at noon Pacific time (8PM UTC) we’re planning on having our second ever On Air Hangout. [Last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5xBDBnxoVc "First XBMC Hangout") was focused primarily on answering questions. This go around, we’re going to focus more on the various things we brought with us to SCALE, but we’ll certainly be leaving time for questions as well. If you’ve got questions or comments, feel free to ask in the comments below. To be certain you get any updates on this Hangout, you’ll probably want to +1 our [Google+ page](https://plus.google.com/+XBMC/posts "XBMC Google+ page"), though we’ll be certain to also send out a link to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/XBMC "XBMC on Facebook") and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xbmc "XBMC on Twitter").

 Whether we see you in person or only online, we’ll love to see you soon.
