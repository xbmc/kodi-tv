It’s been over a year in the works and today we are excited to announce that XBMC 11.0 is finally ready and available for download. You can [find XBMC 11.0 here](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "Download XBMC 11.0").

XBMC 11.0 Milestones include [Addon Rollbacks](https://kodi.wiki/natethomas/2011/10/20/xbmc-addon-rollbacks/ "XBMC Rollback Review"), vast improvements in [Confluence](https://kodi.wiki/natethomas/2011/10/07/xbmc-eden-skinning-changes/ "Confluence Update Review") (the default skin), massive speed increases via features like Dirty-region rendering and the new JPEG decoder, a simpler, better library, movie set scraping, additional protocol handling, better networking support, better handling of unencrypted BluRay content and structures, adjustable display refresh rate in OSX (to match the already available feature in Windows and Linux), AirPlay support, an upgraded [weather service](https://www.wunderground.com/ "Thanks for your support, Weather Underground!") with geoip lookup, and much, much more. Check out the highlights in the [summarized changelog](http://mirrors.xbmc.org/releases/11.0-Eden-changelog.txt "XBMC 11 changelog").

 The new Confluence

In addition to our many software improvements, we’ve increased our reach in the realm of hardware support since Dharma was released. Eden marks the first in-sync stable release for the [Apple TV2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV "Apple TV 2"), [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad/ "iPad"), and other iOS devices. We’ve vastly improved the method by which we handle input, including heavily upgrading JSON-RPC support, making remote control support much, MUCH simpler in Windows, and enabling unique methods of device communication with hardware. And now even AMD devices are supported for GPU video decoding in Linux to some extent, thanks to the inclusion of [VAAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API "VAAPI Wiki Page").

Beyond XBMC 11 for Windows, Linux, OSX, and iOS, we are also happy to announce XBMCbuntu Final.

XBMCbuntu is very similar to past versions of XBMC Live. By default, the user boots directly into XBMC, and if he/she chooses, he or she will never see the underlying OS. However, unlike Live, XBMCbuntu is now built upon a full LXDE desktop environment, which has a web browser (Chromium) with a fully updated (and updatable) version of Flash built-in and a GUI package manager ready to install and update all of the normal Ubuntu programs a typical Linux user might use. The user may now toggle between XBMC, which auto-starts, and a normal desktop if he or she chooses. And, perhaps most exciting for many users, XBMC will now be upgradeable, both from command line and from the GUI package manager, without fear of crashing the XBMC experience.

Naturally, those users who do not want to see the desktop will never need to. When you boot your computer, you will be booted directly into the XBMC homescreen, just as you are right now. The only clear difference is the new power underneath the hood. Those users who have already installed the Beta version of XBMCbuntu can upgrade to final using the apt-get upgrade commands.

There are truly an incredible number of updates and improvements between Dharma and Eden. But don’t take our word for it. [Download XBMC 11.0 Eden now](https://kodi.wiki/download/ "Download XBMC").
