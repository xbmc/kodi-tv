We’d like to inform our users again that we have applied to be a mentoring organization for this year’s [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013 "Google Summer of Code"). As many of you know, we were accepted [last year](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/01/xbmc-rocked-summer.html "XBMC Rocked the Summer of Code") as well as in[2008](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code_2008 "XBMC GSoC 2008 page").

As last year was such a success for the program, we have very high hopes that we might be accepted again this year, particularly given all the excitement surrounding XBMC for Android and other embedded devices, though we recognize that GSoC is always a fierce competition. If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [project Ideas page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code_2013 "GSOC 2013 XBMC Ideas page") and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on.
