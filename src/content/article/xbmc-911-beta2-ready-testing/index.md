![](/images/blog/logo.webp)Development for Camelot is winding down, and we have a new beta for all brave users to try. We have closed just under 200 bugs since the last beta (to be fair, some of those were translations and other small patches). That is an impressive number, thanks to all who have reported their issues. As we are feature frozen, nothing new has been added this time around, we’re purely focusing on fixing bugs.

As always, head on over to the [download](https://kodi.wiki/download/) page for the latest and greatest. The Ubuntu PPAs will be updated soon. Give it a go, and be sure to submit [quality bug reports](../../wiki/?title=HOW-TO_submit_a_proper_Bug_Report) if you have any issues. Also, please keep great the translations coming!

**Please Note**: The comment section below is NOT a support forum. You are welcome to voice your concerns here but please use the [proper](https://forum.kodi.tv/) [channels](http://trac.xbmc.org) if you wish to be helped.
