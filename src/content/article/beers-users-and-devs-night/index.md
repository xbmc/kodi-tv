[![fkoch_lederhosen_klein](/images/blog/fkoch_lederhosen_klein-207x300.webp)](/images/blog/fkoch_lederhosen_klein.webp)We apologize for the late notice, but for those of you in the Munich area we finally have a date and time for our Devs and Users Meet-up.

    We’ll be meeting at the NH München Dornach, Einsteinring 20. D-85609 Dornach. Munich at 19.30 (that’s 7:30PM for Americans) on this Friday. Just head over to the hotel bar, and we’ll get things rolling from there.

If you can make it, definitely let us know in the comments!
