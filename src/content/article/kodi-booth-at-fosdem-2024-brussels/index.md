Hi!

This is just a quick note to let everyone know that Team Kodi will be present at the [Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting (FOSDEM)](fosdem.org) in Brussels on 3 & 4 February 2024. We will be having a **[booth in Building H level 1](https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/)** where you can try out Kodi and chat with us at your leisure :)
