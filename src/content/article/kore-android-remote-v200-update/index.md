It has been a while since we talked about our official Android remote and to the outside all seemed quiet. Nothing is further from the truth. We are happy to announce that our official Kore remote is getting a big update. Our developer *SyncedSynapse* has been putting a lot of work on including new features and improving what was already there. Additionally it’ s also great to see that developers from outside of the team are helping getting it better. Many thanks go out to them as well. This is what opensource is all about.

 From seeing the number of Google Play downloads we can tell the community loves the Kore remote as well since it’s nearly at 500.000 active users. This is great news too see a lot of you are using it and makes the effort put in it extra worthwhile. Hopefully this with this new update the numbers of users will grow even more.

 The update
----------

 The interface has kept is simple and easy to use interface as we all love. Below we’ ll pick out some of the new features that were added you didn’ t notice yet.

 **Live TV and PVR/DVR**

 One of the most requested features to be added was Live TV and PVR/DVR control and now those users could rejoice. With this update you will see a new PVR item in the side menu which now guides you to a list of channels that are available on your Kodi installation the remote is currently connected to. The list shows what is currently playing and using the three dots on the side you can either call up the EPG (Electronic Program Guide) or start recording.

 All this is of course only possible if you already have your Live TV and PVR/DVR set up and working. Be sure to check out the wiki page for information how to get started: <https://kodi.wiki/view/PVR>

 **Add-ons**

 Maybe you hadn’ t noticed yet but you can also starts any add-on from the remote so you don’ t have to browse through the Kodi interface. This saves you several clicks and afterwards you can continue controlling it with the D-pad in the Kodi interface.

 **YouTube**

 Maybe a bit hidden however you can also send any YouTube video to Kodi through the remote control. The feature is hidden under the *share* button in the YouTube app which shows the Kore icon as target.

 **Send text to media center**

 Entering text in the Kodi dialogs can be quite hard when you have to use the on screen keyboard. With Kore you can type the entire text you want on your phone and then send it to Kodi. This features is can be called from the three button which are located on the top right corner in the remote. Library maintenance, toggle full-screen and sorting and refresh options are also listed there depending on which section you are using.

 **Directional** **keys controlling video playback**

 Due to a limitation in Kodi there’s not an easy method for controlling video playback with the directional keys like skipping. For this you have to enable and option called EventServer in the settings of the Kodi installation you want to use it on. It’s a simple check mark in the same section where you added a new media center you wanted to control.

 **Likely there’s more**

 The points mentioned above are things that are most visible and requested. However there’s several more minor things that were added or slightly changed. We’ll let you find these things out for yourself as we feel that using the remote should as self exploratory as possible. People shouldn’t need to read a guide how to use it. Further down the page we added some screenshots to give you some idea how the remote looks before you proceed to installing it. Hopefully you enjoy it as much as we do.
