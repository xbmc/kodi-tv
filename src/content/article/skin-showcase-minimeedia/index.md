### Author’s description (skunkm0nkee)

 The idea for the skin grew out of the feedback we got for the MediaStream skin. A lot of users seemed to want to make MediaStream pretty much transparent so that they could see the background images better. Since MediaStream was designed to focus on the media it wasn’t really practical to adapt it for that purpose. Instead I decided to create a new skin from scratch where the core concept was to make the skin itself very minimal so that the backgrounds could shine through.

 At the moment the skin is still effectively in public beta as I’m still adding a few finishing touches (including a new design for the Showcase view) and fixing any issues/bugs that are reported by users. So far the feedback has been excellent and very helpful in moving the development along. A number of users have even pitched in and translated the skin into their language (Danish, Dutch, English, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish so far) and hopefully we’ll soon get a few more to help us with further translations (such as French, German, Italian etc).

 Overall I’m very pleased with how the skin has turned out. It still holds to it’s original minimal design concept but the fluid animation, fully implemented feature set (including file manager and all the various dialogs) and ease of use (hopefully) make it enjoyable for users to play about with. I think it’s a skin that comes across better in use than it may in the screenshots as it’s only when you start using it that you begin to really appreciate how well it works.
