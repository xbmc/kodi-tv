[![scale10x](/sites/default/files/uploads/scale10x-300x222.webp "scale10x")](/sites/default/files/uploads/scale10x.webp)Just a quick note everyone. XBMC will once again be in attendance at the [Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE 10x)](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale10x/ "SCALE 10x"), and we’d love to see everyone who isn’t TOO far away. Right now, it’s looking like Malloc (Sean), theuni (Cory), Keith (Keith), and I (Nate) will all be there with a primo booth to show off some pretty exciting software and hardware that maybe not everyone has seen quite yet (fingers crossed).

If you’d like to make the trip, SCALE is happening January 20th through the 22nd (about two weeks from now) at the Hilton LAX Airport hotel. Our booth will be up on the 21st and 22nd, and you might be able to sneak a peak at us setting up on the 20th. Our Meet Up last year was, perhaps, not the rousing success that we might have hoped for, but if anyone expresses interest in the comments, we’d love to do another one. This time, we might even try to go somewhere slightly closer to the Expo area!
