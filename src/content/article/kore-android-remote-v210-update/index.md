It has been a while since we talked about our official Android remote and to the outside all seemed quiet. Nothing is further from the truth. We are happy to announce that our official Kore remote is getting an update. Our developers _SyncedSynapse_ and _poisdeux_ have been putting a lot of work on including new features and improving what was already there. Additionally it’ s also great to see that developers from outside of the team are helping getting it better. Many thanks go out to them as well. This is what opensource is all about.

From seeing the number of Google Play downloads we can tell the community loves the Kore remote as well since it’s nearly at 780.000 active users. This is great news too see a lot of you are using it and makes the effort put in it extra worthwhile. Hopefully this with this new update the numbers of users will grow even more.

## Upcoming version 2.1.0

• Add songs tab on Music section and Artist section and support for showing songs without album or artist  
 • Add add-on browsing has now been made easy as you can navigate the add-ons from your phone and start the videos  
 • Show artist details when an artist is selected from the list  
 • New option: pause playing when in a phone call (requires permission to phone state on Android versions \< 6.0)  
 • New option: keep the remote above the lockscreen  
 • Support for playing Vimeo URLs  
 • Improve library syncing  
 • Various UI tweaks  
 • Bug fixes

There have been several language updates however if you language is missing feel free to submit it to our [code repository](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore) and we’ll include it next time.  
 This update will be available to every one if it passes the check by our loyal tester who have subscribed to the Play Store alpha/beta testing program. So if you are not receiving the update yet just have a little patience and I’m sure it will be there soon.

**UPDATE (19 July 2016):**
