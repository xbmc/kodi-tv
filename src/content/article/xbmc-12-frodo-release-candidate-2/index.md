 At this point, XBMC 12 is entirely feature complete. All changes from this point forward will exclusively include fixes for replicable bugs necessary to reach final release.

 Fixes between RC1 and RC2 include resolution of incorrectly disabling audio devices due to faulty detection, which should resolve all or most “audio suddenly stops altogether” complaints, along with numerous other stability enhancements and minor fixes. For the full list, visit our [Github milestones for RC2](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues?milestone=13&state=closed "XBMC 12 RC2 Milestones").
