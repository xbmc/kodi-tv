Congratulations to our friends over at OpenELEC for their release of OpenELEC 3.0.0! OpenELEC is an embedded operating system built around XBMC designed to be as lightweight as possible.

 OpenELEC 3.0.0 incorporates XBMC 12.1 with support for NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel solutions, along with a dedicated Raspberry Pi build. In addition to XBMC 12.1 and the Raspberry Pi port, 3.0.0 brings stable AMD XVBA video decoding, along with many other stability improvements and other improvements across the entire platform.
