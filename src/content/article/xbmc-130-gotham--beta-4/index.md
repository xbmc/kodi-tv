With Beta 4 we are only looking at bug fixing rather than features. Further down we will list several of the more important fixes that have been added since last beta. Hopefully Beta 4 will be the last one, before we will enter Release Candidate stage. This means final release is nearing.

 For a full run down of the major features of XBMC 13, as well as a review of the hazards of switching to XBMC 13, see our [Beta 1 post](https://kodi.wiki/xbmc-13-0-gotham-beta1-rises/). The list of all Gotham related news can be found [here](https://kodi.wiki/tag/gotham/) listing all past blog posts.

 After upgrade
-------------

 After you have updated from Frodo or any earlier alpha or beta it might pay of, to force refresh the XBMC.org repository. This is to make sure the most recent repository list is loaded and needed updates become available. This could be the case when wanting to use the new subtitle downloading feature and you cannot find the new services to install. Doing it regardless doesn’t hurt. Here’s a quick how-to found on our wiki: [Force refresh](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager)

  

 Skins
-----

 Creating a skin for XBMC takes many months of designing, coding, testing, tweaking and a lot of patience to get it just right. However with every major XBMC release there is the problem of skins becoming incompatible due to various code changes. So for every release people who put a lot of effort creating these skins, need to adapt it for the next XBMC version. This could mean that your favourite skin doesn’t work in the next XBMC version. We are very glad to say, that thanks to a group of skin developers, there are already 9 Gotham compatible skins available in XBMC.org repository. From memory this has never happened before, that within beta stage there are that many already available for you to enjoy using. On our forum there are several more skins being worked on, to get these into shape for people to use. So hopefully by the time of final release, there will be several more available. So let’s all thank the developers for their hard work they do for the XBMC community.

 Available in our Gotham repository are:
