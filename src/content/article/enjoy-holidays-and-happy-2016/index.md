We hope you all enjoyed the Christmas diner and are now spending some quality time using Kodi as your media center. Since we’ll probably have nothing to report in coming week we as team already want to wish you all a happy 2016. Sorry, no surprise release this time.

The new year will hold a lot of exciting Kodi news which we’ll absolutely share with you through our website. Soon we’ll be releasing Kodi v16.0 as release candidate and if all goes well not long after the final version. This version has several exciting features added. Be sure to read up on that [here.](/category/pre-release) Later down the year we’ll also start our early alpha builds again for what will be version 17. This version will have a completely revamped videoplayer so that’s at least something to look forward to.

That’s it for now as we’ll all go back to spending some time with family and/or friends and getting ready for the new year. Wish you all the best and till next year.
