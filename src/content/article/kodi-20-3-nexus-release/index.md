Thanks, as always, to everyone who has helped us track down and fix any issues. We endeavour to minimise the issues everyone experiences, but with such a large project, and the fact everyone contributing to Kodi is a volunteer, issues and bugs are a part of life. If you happen to experience any bugs/issues, don't hesitate to reach out on the forums, or raise an issue on Github.

As this is a point release, there are no major changes since the previous version, and you should be fine to install this straight over the top of any existing Kodi 20.x installation - indeed, this will happen automatically on many platforms. However, as for all software installations, back up your userdata beforehand if you've any doubts or have anything you can't afford to lose (and definitely do this if you're going for a major version upgrade).

A list of all changes for this version can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestone/159?closed=1). If you want to read back on the full history of v20 itself, or of previous versions, you can find the corresponding articles in the relevant [blog posts](https://kodi.tv/blog/tag/release).

Application deployment on different platforms (notably the Microsoft Store) can vary considerably due to circumstances outside of our control, so just be patient, and the update will inevitably find its way through.

**Android Deployment**

13th January, 10:00 UTC: After the initial problems with 20.3 on Google Play ("Cannot download OBB"), **@fuzzard** has done a sterling job and has now released an updated version into the wild. Testing suggests that it's installing correctly now, and so will be available to all Android users imminently.

Thanks for bearing with us on this. Apologies again for any inconvenience, and, please, let us know if you have any problems (or, indeed, if you're an Android developer who might want to give us some help...).
