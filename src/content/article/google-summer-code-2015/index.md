We’d like to inform our users that we have applied to be a mentoring organization for this year’s [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015 "Google Summer of Code"). As many of you know, we were accepted in [2013](/article/google-summer-code-2013-students-get-ready "2013 Announcement"), [2012](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/01/xbmc-rocked-summer.html "XBMC Rocked the Summer of Code"), and [2008](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code_2008 "XBMC GSoC 2008 page").

 We recognize that GSoC is always a fierce competition, but we are, as ever, hopeful that we will join many other fine organizations in a great summer of hacking. If you are a student interested in applying, please head over to our [project Ideas page](https://kodi.wiki/view/Google_Summer_of_Code/2015 "GSOC 2015 Kodi Ideas page") and begin thinking about what you might like to hack on.
