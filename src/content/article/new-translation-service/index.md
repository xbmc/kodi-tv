![](/sites/default/files/uploads/API.407b6280f366.webp "Transifex")As some of you might have noticed, we are in the process of making life for all hard working translators a whole lot easier. And for those of you who wanted to contribute with translating XBMC but have always thought it was too much hassle, we have now made it easier than ever.

Attila Jakosa have been working hard on changing the current xml-based translations into [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) standard, allowing for the use of a web based translation service.

With this standard in mind, the Team has decided to use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/XBMC-Main-Frodo/) as a collabarative online translation service, with advantages like

- Translation teams
- Shared translation memory
- Syntax checking
- Web editor
- Suggestions

See the forum [post](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=132639) for more information and discussion on this.

If you feel like contributing, please don’t hesitate to [register](https://www.transifex.net/plans/signup/free/) @ Transifex and request to join your native language team.

Transifex should be fairly easy to pick up and use in translations, but if you have any questions, post them in the appropriate [forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=90).

_Note to add-on developers: This will in the near future extend to all add-ons in the XBMC repository, so there is no need to go about creating your own projects._

**UPDATE:** If you have in the past translated XBMC to your language, please PM blittan on the forums and you will automatically become a coordinator for your language.

**UPDATE2:** There is now a [wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Translation_System) page for some help regarding Transifex.
