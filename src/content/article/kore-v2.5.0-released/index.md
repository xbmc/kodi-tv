## Kore v2.5.0 Released!

Team Kodi are proud to announce the release of the latest version of our Kore Android remote application. Team members and other contributors have added several great new features which we think users will love. The changes for this new version includes:

- Improved PVR section: new search option, sort recordings and hide watched items.
- Add support for sharing local files to Kodi, by using the side menu "Local Files", or by choosing Kore as the share target for a file.
- Allow changing Kore's language in Settings.
- Add new sort option for albums, movies and tv shows (by year).
- New color themes (Sunrise and Sunset) and tweaks to the others.
- Show all the available playlists (in the playlist screen), even when nothing's playing.
- New translations (Korean, Slovak)
- Bug fixes and UI tweaks.

The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/xbmc/Kore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

Kore is available as a free download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kore), and also from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.xbmc.kore/).
