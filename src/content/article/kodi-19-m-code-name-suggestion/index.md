Since the dawn of time, or at least since 2008 each released version has received a code name next to the version number. Giving each development iteration a code name in a certain category is kind of a tradition that is not only applicable for software but also for hardware. Google does so for Android and Intel also names their chips. Who are we to break this tradition and as such we follow in their steps with a theme that started out with mythical places or names.

 With Kodi v18 *Leia* heading towards final release (currently in Beta stage) we’ll need a new code name that will be added to v19 which our developers will be working on in due time. Don’t worry we’ll still look after any bug that might pop up in *Leia* and try to fix it first.

 **History**

 Below are the code names we have used in the past to give you an idea.

     **Atlantis**

     **Babylon**

     **Leia**

     **M********  
19.0 (In a far distant future….)

    As you can see we now arrived at the next version that will start with the letter **M**. We thought it might be a good idea to ask the users to send in suggestions on what the next code name should be. You can post your suggestions on our forum: [Kodi v19 Name Suggestion](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=330506). So up to you to suggest a great code name that will be added to Kodi v19. The team will take all suggestions in consideration and picks the most appropriate.
