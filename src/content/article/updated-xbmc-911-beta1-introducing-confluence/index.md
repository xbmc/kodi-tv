![Confluence_Logo](/sites/default/files/uploads/Confluence_Logo1.png "Confluence_Logo")As the testing portion of Camelot continues, we would like to introduce Confluence as the new default XBMC skin. We have also stopped including the original Project Mayhem III skin (Don’t worry, PM3.HD is still there). It will be added to the gallery soon, but for now you can find it [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xboxmediacenter/files/XBMC%20Skins/Project%20Mayhem%20III/Project_Mayhem_III.rar/download).

 A ‘Confluence’ is the coming together of many things into one point, and the skin lives up to that for sure. Jezz\_X started it as a progression of his MediaStream\_Redux, but it has evolved into something entirely different from its origins. You’ll surely notice that it shares a home-screen ‘blade’ with MediaStream, a settings screen feel with Aeon, views from many other skins, etc. In short, he’s used ideas from existing skins to make a coherent amalgamation that is both sexy and easy to use. Feel free to visit the [gallery](https://kodi.tv/skins/confluence) for screenshots or the [forum](https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=125) to discuss the skin.

  ### Soft String Freeze

 Also for this release, the settings cleanup is in the final stages. For the most part, we’ve reorganized and renamed everything that needed attention. All that’s left now is the finishing touches. As a result, you may notice that some of your settings have reverted to the new defaults. Please double-check this before submitting bug reports.

 While strings are not completely frozen yet, we ask at this time that translators begin submitting their translations, paying special attention to the settings and Confluence. There should be no new strings and no drastic changes from here on out, only tweaks where they are needed.

 ### Skin Freeze

 We’re introducing a skin freeze for this release in an effort to improve the experience of users and alleviate some of the stress for skinners. From this point on, the XBMC skinning engine should be considered frozen, meaning that only bugfixes will be committed. We ask that all skinners take this opportunity to be sure that your skins work with Beta1. Starting with Camelot, the [skin gallery](/slideshow/skins) will reflect the skins that work in the current STABLE version of XBMC. If skinners wish to link to skins that work on unstable versions of XBMC, they should make the distinction VERY clear on their skin page and optimally link to their forum for all necessary information. We hope that this will help to clear the confusion for the many casual users of XBMC who don’t visit the forum, but want to see the skins that will work in the latest stable version.

 ### Downloads

 As always, head to the [download](https://kodi.wiki/download/) page for the latest stable and pre-release versions. **Update:** All versions should be up and in working order now. There was a packaging accident which disabled vdpau in linux builds. This has been fixed, and PPAs and Live builds are now ready.
