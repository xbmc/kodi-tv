In another bit of late news, here’s a cool new app from EqUiNoX. This handy (and skinnable) program lets you control XBMC from anywhere on your network. Sadly, it’s Windows only so I can’t test it myself, though I’m sure it’s up to EqUiNoX’s usual high standards.

 Head over to the [Team Blackbolt](http://www.teamblackbolt.co.uk/projdetails.php?id=9) site to get the app and the source. Keep in mind that this is not an official tool so please don’t report any bugs that may result from its use; use [his bug tracker](https://code.google.com/archive/p/teamblackbolt-xbmcvirtualcontroller/issues) instead.
