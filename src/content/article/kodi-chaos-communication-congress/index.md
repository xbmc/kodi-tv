For the next few days the 36th Chaos Communication Congress, the largest hacker conference in Europe, is held in Leipzig, Germany. Organized by the Chaos Computer Club, it features a lot of tech related talks and assemblies.

Kodi will be represented by Sarbes, one of our Python developers. A talk about the project is scheduled at 3pm on the first day, at the ChaosZone (<https://cfp.chaoszone.cz/36c3/talk/V83NXN/>).

If you happen to be at the congress, Sarbes can be reached via our IRC channel (#kodi @freenode). Feel free to reach out to him to ask questions and/or to buy him a beer.
