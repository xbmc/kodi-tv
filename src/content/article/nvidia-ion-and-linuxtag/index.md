As promised, here are some pictures of the NVIDIA ION box which were so kindly lent out to us during LinuxTag. Big thanks to NVIDIA for making this happen ![:)](/images/blog/icon_smile.gif)

Before sending it back to NVIDIA (with a tear in my eye, wanted to keep it ![;)](/images/blog/icon_wink.gif) ) I gave it a quick testspin, since I didn’t get to play with it all that much during LinuxTag. My impression of that small box was that no matter what you fed it the playback didn’t stutter and was smooth and crisp. I have watched blueray on PS3 using the same TV and although that was fine, I don’t think the NVIDIA did any worse. Too bad my friend wasn’t home so we could try it out on his reference projector ![:(](/images/blog/icon_sad.gif)
