This is just a quick blog post to tell you about a presentation that might be of interest. Glenn Guy (**Aussie Addons**) is giving a presentation on Meetup this Thursday, 24th September, at 18:00 AEST (07:00 UTC) for the Sydney Video Technology group. It's featuring some pretty big names in the Video VOD world.

It came about because the host - Jeremy, the Associate Director of Video Delivery at Optus Sports - made contact on Twitter wondering how the Optus Sport addon was playing back SSAI when their Android app couldn't yet. Matt Huismann (another contributor) explained that Glenn had added X-discontinuity support for live streams into Inputstream Adaptive, and that IA and Kodi was doing all the work. We put him in contact with Glenn - and now Glenn is doing a presentation about it.

He will be mainly talking about Kodi + Inputstream Adaptive + Disney addon (how he added features to IA to accomplish that)
