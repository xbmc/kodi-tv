I long suspected something to not be 100% correct with Intel’s Linux drivers for Graphics, so before this weekend I set out to do some benchmarking. Here’s what happened before:

 I chatted briefly with people in #Intel-gfx on [FREENODE](http://freenode.net/) earlier this week, understandably they thought I was *bitching*, I can’t blame them ![;)](/sites/default/files/uploads/icon_wink.gif) A couple of days earlier I tried XBMC+projectM @1080p on my Mac Mini that I won @ DevCon (Thanks [Boxee](http://blog.boxee.tv)!). I did this test, because I’m VERY disappointed with the 5 (five) FPS I get on XBMC+projectM on my more powerful Aopen MiniPC using Ubuntu 8.04.1

 So I tested [projectM](http://projectm.sourceforge.net/) on OSX, and I got a **mindblowing** 20-60fps (30-40 average)FPS! I had heard that OS X had better drivers for Intel Graphics than Linux, but this was just ridiculous.

 Some days later, some chaps in #intel-gfx suggested I did a little benchmarking. First someone suggested q3a (Quake 3 Arena) but this game is so old it won’t even install in OS X 10.5. Someone then suggested [Nexuiz](http://www.alientrap.com/games/nexuiz/), a FOSS game that runs on Linux, OS X & Windows.

 Here’s what my testing resulted in:

 Now I need to find a good way to let Intel Linux Driver Developers know about these results. If you got any tips, please email or leave a comment
