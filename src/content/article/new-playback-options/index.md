For those who are picky about “judder” or jerky playback due to the difference in video source and display FPS, your screams have been heard. Play around with the new settings to find your favorite, you’ll find them in the “player” section of the video options. Be careful not to give yourself a headache from staring at the screen while comparing sync methods (as I did). And be sure to thank bobo1on1 for this excellent feature.

 For a technical explanation of the new settings, please see the forum post [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?pid=336538%23pid336538). Note that you won’t find these options in the current 9.04.1 release, you’ll have to compile from svn or use a new 3rd party build.
