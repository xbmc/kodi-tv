## Join the millions already enjoying Kodi

Kodi is available as a native application for Android, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS and Windows operating systems, running on most common processor architectures. A small overview of the features can be found on our about page. For each platform, we offer a stable and development release(s). For normal users we recommend installing the stable releases.

## Older Releases

Please note, development of the v18 "Leia" line has ended. If you discover a bug in v18, please test if the bug is also present in v19 and submit your bug report for v19 if present. While we do not recommend using old builds, you can [download an old build](http://mirrors.kodi.tv/releases/) from our mirrors site if you need to.

## Source Code

Current development is done in our git repository. The source can be viewed online, downloaded, or cloned from our github repository:

`$ git clone git://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git`
